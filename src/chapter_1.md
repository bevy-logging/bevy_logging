# Println! and eprintln

## Println!
The first tool which you may reach for when you experience unexpected behaviour is `println!`.
`println!` can be used, as the name suggests, to print values at key points of your program where your issue might lie.

However 
- Typing, or more likely copying and pasting `println!`'s everywhere gets quite tedious.
- Each `println!` should, in most cases, have some marking string that lets you know which one triggered, otherwise you have to do additional searching.
- At some point, these `println!`'s need to be removed, or they will block up the logging.
