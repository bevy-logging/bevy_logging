# Other Subscribers

So far all that has been presented is the fmt subscriber for text output but Tracing can do more then that.
Note I haven't needed to use multiple subscribers, so far I just change globabl subscriber and leave it at that.

## Bunyan Subscriber

I don't know what bunyan formatter is just someone thought it was mentioning, who am I to disagree?
